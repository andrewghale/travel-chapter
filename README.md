## Notes on Friday afternoon (11th Oct)

This was a quick exercise to recreate the styling for Travel Chapter's website. On Friday 11th Oct I had collectively spent about 5 hours on it, starting from scratch.

There are a few minor differences; mainly the responsive styling in the footer.

If I were to continue the project I would have refactored the SCSS so that it was more usable for a multiple page site, included slick.js in the project (which is an image slider) as well as adding a bit more interactivity on the page. Converting the gulpfile to ES6 syntax would be a good idea too.
